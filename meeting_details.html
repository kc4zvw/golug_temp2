    <dt class="www_subsection">Meeting for January 6, 2021 at 07:00 PM (EST)</dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>

    <p>Steve Litt and Syeed Ali each discuss recently building a Linux computer from parts.<br />
    Each will answer the following questions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What made me buy a new computer when I had a AMD 2 core and 16GB RAM already?</li>
      <li>With Covid and the loss of almost all bricks and mortar computer stores, what were the challenges
              of picking my a-la-carte mix of components?</li>
      <li>What rough patches did I encounter, and in what ways did or didn't they relate to Linux?</li>
      <li>How does the final result stack up?</li>
    </ul>

    <dt class="www_subsection">Meeting Audio Best Practices</dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <ul>
        <li>On many distros, audio can't be made to work in Firefox. If so, Chromium is the browser of choice.</li>
        <li>Adjust your mike level to be just sensitive enough to have you heard full volume but not enough that background noise comes through.</li>
        <li>If possible, listen through headphones, not speakers. Speakers create feedback and cause other listening
        problems. If you <em>must</em> listen through speakers, keep their volume<br /> as low as possible and keep them away from
        the microphone. Listening through laptop speakers with the laptop microphone enabled is a sure way to have echo, noises,<br />
        and audio artifacts, so if you're using a laptop, please mute your mike except when talking.</li>
        <li>If possible, use a real microphone rather than the built-in laptop microphone. The built in microphones are usually
        multidirectional and much too far from your mouth to<br /> distinguish between your voice and background sound.</li>
        <li>Keep your audio muted except when you need to talk. In Jitsi, you can mute and unmute your mike just by clicking on the
        microphone icon on the bottom near the center.</li>
        <li>Arrive a few minutes early to iron out audio problems you might have.</li>
      </ul>

    <dt class="www_subsection">Other Meeting Best Practices</dt>
    <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Some presenters feel better when you leave your camera on so the presenter can gauge your level of interest and tweak the presentation accordingly.</li>
        <li>When the presenter shares his/her screen, if the letters or graphics are blurry, increase your Jitsi video resolution. Just
          click the three dots on the<br /> bottom right, then select "Manage video quality", and use the slider to increase the video quality
          until letters being presented are clear.</li>
        <li>Chromium is an absolute pig, and uses up CPU faster than a random number generator. You can make the best of a bad
          situation:</li>
        <li>Have only your Jitsi session open in Chromium: No other tabs. No other instances of Chromium.</li>
        <li>Clear Chromium's cache by browsing (in Chromium) to <a href="chrome://settings/clearBrowserData">here</a>.</li>
        <li>Run Chromium at a high priority, like <code> nice -n -18 chromium</code> and running it at a high priority minimizes sound dropouts and screen freezes.</li>
        <li>If possible, close out all Firefox sessions. Firefox is a little less of a pig, but piggy enough to gobble some CPU.</li>
        <li>Close unneeded programs.</li>
        <li>Hot tip: Run gkrelm to view CPU usage in real time.</li>
        <li>Please type your name or nickname into the name field when you join the meeting, so we don't refer to you as "fellow jitster" or "hey you". </li>
        <li>Most of these best practices are true for all conferencing software, not just Jitsi.</li>
      </ul>
